# Investigating Gamification Principles for Increasing Physcial Activity

<p>Academic: Lennon, Marilyn</p>

<p><b>Background</b></p> 
It is often claimed that introducing gaming principles (such as leveling up, closure, reward, social comparison) to mobile health apps might increase the users motivation, positively affect their engagement with the app, and sustain their use for a longer period of time increasingly the likelihood that positive health behaviours are increased and bad behaviours changed. Very little is known however about which techniques work best, how to integrate them into your app or game and moreover how to demonstrate or measure intention to change or actual behaviour change (which requires very long controlled trials). 

<p><b>Aim</b></p> 
The aim of this project is to empirically investigate several features present in games and design and build them into a test platform and prototype game (or games) to investigate their potential efficacy in increasing motivation, engagement or intention to change. This will involve not building one sinlge fully functional app or game but rather a platform to allow the study of different interactive gaming techniques and principles to advance the research in this area. The student will also (with support) use qualitative measures from behavioural science to explore how computing scientists can best measure motivation and intention to change. The student must be interested in interactive mobile apps (especially games and those applied to health) and in rapid prototyping and conducting user studies.
